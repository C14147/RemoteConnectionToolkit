_A Development Kit for Remote Connection and Based on Python3._

## About This Project

I was influenced by various remote desktop software(especially PowerToys), and developed this project using socket interface. It establishes a connection between two computers and controls them through instructions. This connection is bidirectional, which means that this project is useful for remote login, remote collaboration, and file transfer.

## How did it work

I use Python 3 to call the socket interface of the system, establishing one as a server and the other as a client. When the client initiates a connection to the server, they will send their tool version and network IP information to the other party to ensure the security and stability of remote transmission. Afterwards, they will wait for the user's command to be issued. The instructions and execution results will be transmitted to the corresponding computer through the TCP protocol.

## Getting Started

### 1.Setting up

Download the source code to your computer.\
```bash
git clone https://github.com/C14147/RemoteConnectionToolkit.git
```
**ðŸ‘‰ The tool versions of two computers must have the same digits except for the third digit! The project has strong scalability and there are many areas that need improvement and optimization.**

### 2.Start Programming

Here is a detailed explanation of the RemoteConnection class.\
The RemoteConnection class has the following member functionsï¼š

```python3
class RemoteConnection:
    def __init__(self, remoteIP: str, port: int, debugGUI=False): ...
	def getLocalAddress(self) -> str: ...
	def send(self, msg) -> int: ...
	def sendString(self, msg: str) -> int: ...
	def passiveConnect(self, timeout=10): ...
	def initiativeConnect(self, timeout=10): ...
	def listen(self, funcList: dict): ...
```

#### RemoteConnection(remoteIP: str, port: int, debugGUI=False):

This function takes three parameters.

_remoteIP: str_

The first parameter is the IP address of the computer you want to connect to. \
ðŸ‘‰ When initiating a remote connection **in a passive manner**, a constant other than the IP address can be used: WRCD_ANY_IP_ADDRESS.It allows **any IP to connect the computer** and begin communication after compatibility and security checks.

_port: int_

The port used when establishing a connection on a computer.

_debugGUI=False_

If the parameter is True, the program will create a window for debugging.

#### getLocalAddress():

Obtain the IP host name or IP address of the local machine.

#### send(msg):

The usage is the same as _socket.send_.

#### sendString(msg: str):

Function for sending string messages to remote computers.

#### passiveConnect(timeout=0):

Start in passive mode and wait for other computers to connect. Equivalent to establishing a server on the computer executing the code.\
The â€˜timeoutâ€™ parameter specifies the maximum duration of waiting for a connection, measured in seconds. When timeout=0, the computer executing the code will wait until the process ends or another computer connects.

#### initiativeConnect(timeout=0):

Start in initiative mode and wait for other computers to connect. Equivalent to establishing a client on the computer executing the code.\
The â€˜timeoutâ€™ parameter specifies the maximum duration of waiting for a connection, measured in seconds. When timeout=0, the computer executing the code will wait until the process ends or another computer connects.

#### listen(funcList: dict):

Start listening for requests from connected computers.\
ðŸ‘‰ This function will **block the process**. This means you need to **create a new thread** for this function.\
ðŸš¨ **Please execute this function after completing PassiveConnect or InitiativeConnect**. Otherwise, you will receive a gift called Traceback...

### 3.Examples

Here are some examples:

```python
from RemoteConnectionToolkit import *


if __name__ == "__main__":
    remote = RemoteConnection("192.168.0.102", 12345, True)
    remote.initiativeConnect(60)
    remote.listen(builtin_funcs)
```

```python3
from RemoteConnectionToolkit import *


if __name__ == "__main__":
    remote = RemoteConnection(WRCT_ANY_IP_ADDRESS, 12345, True)
    remote.initiativeConnect(30)
    remote.listen(builtin_funcs)
```
